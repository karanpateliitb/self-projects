## 🚦 **Traffic Congestion Modeling System – Report**

### 📌 **Overview**

This project implements a **machine learning pipeline** for simulating and predicting **urban traffic congestion levels** using synthetic yet **realistically generated data**. It integrates data simulation, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, visualization, and prediction into a cohesive class-based architecture.

---

## 🏗️ Structure Summary

### 🔹 `TrafficCongestionModel` class

A modular class encapsulating all functionalities:

* Data generation
* Feature engineering
* Model initialization
* Training and evaluation
* Visualization
* Real-time prediction

### 🔹 Main Workflow

* `main()` function acts as the driver to run the entire modeling pipeline step-by-step.

---

## 📊 **1. Data Generation and Simulation**

### Method: `generate_realistic_data(n_samples=10000)`

Generates synthetic but realistic traffic data using:

* **Time-based features**: `hour`, `day_of_week`, `month`
* **Weather features**: `temperature`, `precipitation`, `wind_speed`
* **Custom congestion logic** mimicking real-world conditions (rush hours, weather impact, weekends, holidays)
* Injects randomness (`noise`) to simulate natural variability

### Derived Features:

* `is_weekend`, `is_rush_hour`, `is_business_hour`
* `temp_extreme`, `heavy_rain`, `high_wind`

✅ Output: Cleaned and labeled DataFrame ready for modeling.

---

## 🧪 **2. Data Preparation**

### Method: `prepare_data(data)`

* Extracts features and target (`congestion_level`)
* Ensures proper variable selection and separation of `X` and `y`

---

## 🧠 **3. Model Initialization**

### Method: `initialize_models()`

Initializes 5 supervised regression models:

* **Linear Regression**
* **Random Forest Regressor**
* **Gradient Boosting Regressor**
* **Support Vector Regressor (SVR)**
* **Multilayer Perceptron Regressor (MLP)**

Each offers trade-offs in bias-variance and interpretability.

---

## 🚂 **4. Model Training and Evaluation**

### Method: `train_and_evaluate(X, y)`

* Splits data into training and testing sets (80/20)
* Standardizes data where necessary (SVR, MLP)
* Evaluates models using:

  * **RMSE** (Root Mean Squared Error)
  * **MAE** (Mean Absolute Error)
  * **R²** (Coefficient of Determination)
  * **Cross-Validation RMSE**
  * **Custom Overall Score**: A weighted metric combining R², RMSE, and MAE
* Stores predictions and metrics in `self.results`

---

## 🧾 **5. Model Comparison and Reporting**

### Method: `display_results()`

* Displays a clean, tabular comparison of models sorted by `Overall_Score`
* Highlights the best performing model with:

  * R²
  * RMSE
  * Overall score

📈 Example Output:

```
Model                RMSE     MAE      R²       CV_RMSE  Score
---------------------------------------------------------------
Gradient Boosting    0.0834   0.0632   0.9201   0.0851   0.8619
...
🏆 BEST MODEL: Gradient Boosting
```

---

## 📊 **6. Visualization and Insight**

### Method: `plot_results(data)`

Generates the following plots:

1. **Horizontal bar chart** of overall model scores
2. **RMSE vs R² scatter plot** – highlights trade-offs
3. **Line chart** of average congestion by hour
4. **Bar chart** of congestion during heavy rain vs normal weather
5. **Actual vs Predicted scatter** for the best model

🔍 Insightful for both model diagnostics and real-world interpretation.

---

## 🔮 **7. Predicting Congestion**

### Method: `predict_congestion(hour, day_of_week, month, temperature, precipitation, wind_speed)`

* Generates a single prediction using the best model from evaluation
* Handles preprocessing automatically (e.g., feature engineering, scaling)
* Returns prediction and model name

### Example:

```python
prediction, model = model.predict_congestion(8, 1, 3, 15, 8, 5)
# Returns ~0.8 congestion during Tuesday rush hour with rain
```

---

## 🔁 **8. Execution: `main()`**

End-to-end pipeline:

* Initialize → Generate → Prepare → Train → Evaluate → Visualize → Predict

### Sample Predictions:

```
Tuesday 8 AM, mild weather: 0.803 (using Gradient Boosting)
Saturday 2 PM, summer: 0.312 (using Gradient Boosting)
```
